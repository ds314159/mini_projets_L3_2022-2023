/*
 * This  is a simple mathematical model used to describe the spread of an infectious disease in a population.
 * In  this model, the population is divided into three compartments: susceptible (S), infected (I), and recovered (R).
 * The basic assumption of this SIR model is that individuals in the susceptible compartment are at risk of becoming infected,
 * while individuals in the infected compartment are infectious and can transmit the disease to susceptible individuals.
 * Individuals in the Recovered compartment are no longer infectious and are  immunised ( can't move to I or S during the study).
 * In this SIR model, birth and death factors are not included, the dynamics of the disease are described by the following system of differential equations:
 *
 *   dS/dt = -beta*S*I
 *   dI/dt =  beta*S*I - gamma*I
 *   dR/dt =  gamma*I
 *
 * Where S, I, and R are respectively the number of susceptible, infected, and recovered individuals,
 * t is time, so dt is a step of time, in this basic model it can be a day for example
 * beta is the transmission rate of the disease (i.e., the probability that a susceptible individual will become infected per time unit),
 * and gamma is the recovery rate of the disease (i.e., the probability that an infected individual will recover or die per time unit).
