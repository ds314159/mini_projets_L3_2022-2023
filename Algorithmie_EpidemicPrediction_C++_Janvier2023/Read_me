                                                             and plotting
                                                             
                                                             


Files included:

- 9 source files in C++ language: 4 epidemic models, each having an .h file and a .cpp file, as well as a main.cpp file allowing testing of the different classes.

- A folder containing Eigen library : I chose Eigen, a library I discovered when we were doing matrix decompositions, because it is simple and fast.

- a jupyter notebook file "Plotting_Epidemic_Models" : it was the safest solution to avoid any compatibility problem with your installation.

- Makefile



Compile and run :

- go to the project directory.

- Command "make" in the terminal : the executable produced is called main.



Functional tests :

- In the main.cpp: each epidemic model is tested in a separate compartment. Each model test produces a data matrix which is stored as a csv file in the working directory.



- Data Plotting : if you have jupyter notebook, launch the execution of the file "Plotting_Epidemic_Models.
                  otherwise : copy and paste file's python instructions to your python application.



The project has been tested on Linux and Windows environments. It works well.
 If any impredictible error occurs, please contact me.
 
 
 
 Thank you for this exciting first semester.
