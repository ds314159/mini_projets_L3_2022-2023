 Hello Mr Duhalde,


 I thought it would be useful to add some indications, in order to make the project easier to handle:


 The project is composed of five source files and a Makefile:

  - Matrix.cpp , Matrix.h : for the matrix class.

  - LinearSystem.cpp , LinearSystem.h : a class allowing abstraction of the equation A*X =B,
    an instance of this class has A and B as private attributes,
    and allows to find X thanks to a method called "solution()".

  - main.cpp : tests and validations, step by step, of the elaborated solutions.
    I took care to add headers and explanations in the output display, so that readability and partitioning are preserved.

  - Makefile: a simple targets and reciepes definitions, as seen in CM. Get into the right folder,
    command "make main" to compile ( executable is named main, ./main to launch execution ).

 The project has been tested on Linux and Windows environments. It works well.
 If any impredictible error occurs, please contact me.

 As you may have noticed, I use English to write and comment my code. This seems to be the 
 norm in the code world, and  it helps me to become more professional.
 
 Think you very much.
